-- NOTES --
  - Followed this scotch.io AngularJS routing tutorial for the initial
    groundwork:
      https://scotch.io/tutorials/single-page-apps-with-angularjs-routing-and-templating
  - Used a Python script (which requires the requests library) to check for
    other client case reference numbers to test the application (ranging from 0
    to 9999) but only found 29, the initial number given. The script can be
    found in the repository
